## These functions were written for the Coursera R Programming Course Week 3 Assignment.

## This function creates a list with methods which could set and get a matrix and its inverse
     makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()){
     inv <- NULL                             
     
     set <- function(y) {                    
     x <<- y                             
     inv <<- NULL                        
     }
    
     get <- function() x                    
     setinverse <- function(inverse) {
     inv <<- inverse 
     }
     getinverse <- function() inv                    
     list(set = set, get = get, 
     setinverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
     }  




## This function attempts to compute the inverse of the matrix returned by the above function. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated, the cached value will be used.
